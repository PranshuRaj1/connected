Full-stack Application
Project Description

This project is a small full-stack application with two main pages.

    Pages

        /stream: This is the streaming page.

        /watch: This is the viewing page.

User Journey

    User 1 opens /stream. They are able to turn on their camera/microphone.

    User 2 opens /stream (e.g., in an incognito tab). They are also able to turn on their camera/microphone. User 1 and User 2 are connected with each other using WebRTC (similar to a Google Meet).

    User 3 opens /watch. User 3 is able to see User 1 and 2 interact with each other, but as a live HLS playback (similar to a YouTube live stream).
